Execute the stored `repository-deep-review` Playbook for:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow `docs/PLAYBOOK-SKILL-COMMAND-TOOL-CONTRACT.md`: keep `build` as primary controller, read the Playbook manifest first, materialize one Step at a time, and prefer fresh host-native child context for each Step.

For diff/PR and protected-contract review, the Playbook composes the atomic `protected-capability-registry`, contract-triangulation, dependency-impact, and forbidden-regression competencies instead of loading the former monolithic registry protocol.

Stay read-only for application source. The existing `.codesleuth/reports/` report write is allowed by the Playbook. Do not replace the Playbook with the legacy monolithic review Skill; the current `repository-deep-review` Skill is only a bounded-slice competence.
