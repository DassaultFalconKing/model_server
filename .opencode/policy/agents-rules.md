# CodeSleuth workflow rules (managed block)

This block is maintained by CodeSleuth when `policy.enforceAgentsMdRules` is
enabled. This policy feature owns only the text between its markers.
Repository/user instructions and other explicitly managed CodeSleuth blocks
outside these markers are outside this feature's ownership and must be
preserved.

- Host owns model, controller, session, permissions, tool routing, and
  execution. CodeSleuth provides discipline and control surfaces; it does not
  replace the host controller.
- **Before the first repository write in every coding-agent session, read
  `.opencode/PROVENANCE-WATERMARK.md`.** Keep one stable opaque actor code for
  that logical session; use `anon` when producer attribution is unavailable
  instead of guessing.
- Agent-authored commits use the deterministic
  `Trace-Id: <actor>-<12 hex>` trailer when the agent controls the commit
  message. CodeSleuth reports/proof workflows bind and load the session
  watermark through `provenance_state_*`. The watermark is attribution
  metadata, never a cryptographic identity or acceptance claim.
- Resolve exact Git identity (exact HEAD/SHA, dirty state, base branch) before
  interpreting changes or making integration/acceptance claims.
- Classify each material change as ordinary feature work inside the current
  architecture, stale/divergent Semantic Refit, or architecture change that
  reopens convergence. Historical green CI does not transfer to a new SHA.
- Exact-head acceptance (EHA): testing is separate from repair. A failed
  acceptance target stays failed; repair creates a new SHA and a new campaign.
- SIB0/SIB1/SIB2 claims apply only when the repository has adopted that
  baseline model; do not assume unproven degrees.
- Before repeating substantial analysis, sync the dedicated Git `reports`
  branch through the `codesleuth-reports` workflow and read the newest relevant
  `.codesleuth/reports/` handoff. Shared reports are derived navigation only.
  Structured `.opencode/state/reviews/**` ledgers stay local and authoritative.
- Preserve user work and configuration. Do not widen permissions, discard work,
  or run destructive reset/clean/force operations without explicit user
  authority.
- Do not silently copy historical implementation hunks or treat reports/graphs
  as stronger evidence than exact current source.
- Managed CodeSleuth instructions do not erase repository-specific sub-tree
  AGENTS.md files or direct user instructions; direct user instructions take
  precedence when they conflict with convenience guidance.
