# EHA campaign evidence

## Atomic contract

**Input:** one immutable exact target SHA, an active durable review checkpoint, a bound producer provenance sidecar, and the required SIB0/SIB1/SIB2 profile results or status request.

**Objective:** start, record, complete, or load EHA campaigns through `eha_state_*` while preserving producer attribution through `provenance_state_*`, without inventing a second evidence authority.

**Output:** campaign ID, structured verdict/repair history, claimable SIB degrees, an optional durable completion marker bound to the finalized report, verified producer watermark for proof/report output, and optional bounded Mermaid projection.

**Stop:** literal current HEAD differs from the campaign target SHA, required review checkpoint is missing, provenance sidecar cannot be verified for the active proof session, durable completion is requested before all three SIB verdicts are PASS, the finalized report is missing or names another target SHA, or a material claim would require raw-rewriting append-only ledger history.

**Must not:** repair the target during a test campaign, inherit PASS across SHAs, raw-rewrite `eha.ndjson`, infer campaign completion from provider-stream shutdown, treat Mermaid as acceptance authority, or treat provenance as cryptographic identity or SIB claimability evidence.

Read `docs/DURABLE-EVIDENCE-STORE.md`, `.opencode/PROVENANCE-WATERMARK.md`, `docs/EXACT-HEAD-ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/SIB-CANDIDATE-SELECTION.md`, and `docs/EHA-REPAIR-LOOP.md`.

For ordinary host-controlled campaigns, after `review_state_start` call `provenance_state_bind` once with the stable opaque actor for that producer session before `eha_state_start_campaign`.

For a trusted GitHub EHA bridge, review identity, canonical provenance, and `campaign_started` are established deterministically before provider/model execution. Load and verify that existing `provenance_state`; do not rebind it from the provider session and do not start a second campaign.

Before producing the final EHA proof/report, call `provenance_state_load` and include its verified watermark. If historical evidence predates provenance, report attribution unavailable rather than inventing it.

EHA records live under `.opencode/state/reviews/<reviewId>/eha.ndjson` as append-only history alongside `review_state`; producer attribution lives in immutable `provenance.json` in that same review directory. The sidecar does not alter ledger verdicts or claimability.

Use `eha_state_start_campaign`, `eha_state_record_verdict`, `eha_state_record_repair`, `eha_state_complete_campaign`, `eha_state_load`, and `eha_state_mermaid`. SIB levels define what is proven; EHA defines which exact SHA the proof belongs to; provenance records who the producer session declared itself to be. A repair commit inherits code history, not acceptance evidence.

`eha_state_complete_campaign` is the only positive completion handshake for a successful EHA bridge run. Call it only after SIB0, SIB1, and SIB2 are durably PASS and the `codesleuth-reports` step has finished writing the bounded report. The tool validates that the report is inside `.codesleuth/reports/` and that its strict `targetSha` front matter equals the campaign target before appending `campaign_completed`. Provider stream EOF is transport state, not EHA authority.

For SIB2 interface composition, the canonical `TUI visual regression / Ubuntu` job in `docs/TUI-VISUAL-REGRESSION.md` is required evidence. Inspect `screen.svg`, `ui.log`, `events.log`, and `analysis.json` when a visual scenario fails.

When stale or divergent work is involved, apply `docs/SEMANTIC-REFIT.md` (`semantic-refit`) before starting a new campaign on the integrated `dev/release-X.Y.Z` head.
